## Objetivo
Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message. Download the corrupted message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/193/message.txt)

## Soluci√≥n
```python
flag_enc = "heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V9AAB1F8}7"

flag = ""
for i in range(12, len(flag_enc),3):
    temp = flag_enc[i:i+3]
    flag += temp[2] + temp[0:2]

print(flag)
```

Al ejecutar el codigo la bandera es: picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_A9AFB178}
